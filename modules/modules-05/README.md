For this assignment, we explored survey data from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver.

There are a number of coupon types in the data, but this assignment explores just two of them. First, analysis is done on coupons to bars and which factors impact acceptance rate. Second, a similar analysis is done on coupons to restaurants in the $20 to $50 range. Given the many attributes of the data set, there are a wide number of possible relevant factors, but just a few are explored for this assignment.

The relevant code, visualization, and summary are provided in the Jupyter notebook in this repository, [module-05-coupon-acceptance.ipynb](./module-05-coupon-acceptance.ipynb).
